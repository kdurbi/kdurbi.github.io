        My name is Kouma. I live in NEPA(North East Pennsylvania). I get along with people easily and love to collaborate. I focus on self-growth and perfecting my crafts of choice.
         I really like to learn whenever possible. I have been learning some other languages but am nowhere near a working level with them.
         That is why I am excited to have come across this amazing opportunity to advance my skillset and change careers!</p2><br><br>
         <p3>Aside from that I like to:</p3>
